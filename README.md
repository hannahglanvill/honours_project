# honours_project: MODELLING THE WORLD ACCORDING TO A BIRD: COMPARING METHODS TO MEASURE OPERATIVE TEMPERATURE TO ASSESS THEIR BIOLOGICAL RELEVENCE

Operative temperature is an important measure to understand microclimates (climate at the scale organisms likely experience it- including shade cover, topography, and soil characteristics). Operative temperature is a single value that includes multiple variables of the thermal environment that affect organisms- including air temperature, solar radiation, convection, conduction, wind, humidity, and the organismâ€™s morphology. Microclimates are being recognised as highly important for species to use as thermal refuges- especially in arid areas. More studies are incorporating microclimates in their predictive studies to understand how climate change will impact species distribution and functioning. I will compare three methods to measure operative temperature- taxidermic mounts, blackbulbs, and a biophysical model using the package 'NicheMapR' in R. Taxidermic mounts are considered to be the most accurate as they include the skin and fur/feathers of the animal. I will use historical data collected using taxidermic mounts and blackbulbs for Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills (Tockus leucomelas) in the Kalahari Desert. Additionally, I will conduct an experiment in a semi-natural location (Schustersrivier, Scarborough, Cape Town) using taxidermic mounts of White-browed Sparrow-Weavers (Plocepasser mahali) and blackbulbs.
